            from <span className="purple"> Lusaka, Zambia ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡².</span>
            <br /> I have been in love with tech from a very young age which led
            me to pursue and obtain a bachelor's degree in Information
            Technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have over 5+ years of expirence creating websites and striking
            visuals that bring ideas to life.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
